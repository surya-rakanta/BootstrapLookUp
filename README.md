Bootstrap Dialog Table Look Up Example

I currently have problem uploading files using web-based github, so you can refer to the article in my post:

https://ekasiswanto.wordpress.com/2017/05/10/bootstrap-dialog-table-look-up-example/

Before running this sample, you have to edit the web.config file first to refer to your properly set connection string.

Then, in your properly installed SQL Server 2005 or higher, create the database named LeaveV2 and its associated tables by running the script.sql in the root folder of this repository

There's sample employee data in the data folder called tEmployee.xlsx that you can import to tEmployee table.

At this stage, the look up example only use tEmployee table. You can ignore other tables that will be used in the next stage of this open source project, perhaps with another name.
