Bootstrap Dialog Table Look Up Example

I currently have problem uploading files using web-based github, so you can refer to the article in my post:

https://ekasiswanto.wordpress.com/2017/05/10/bootstrap-dialog-table-look-up-example/

Before running this sample, you have to edit the web.config file first to refer to your properly set connection string.

Then, in your properly installed SQL Server 2005 or higher, create the database named LeaveV2 and its associated tables by running the script.sql in the root folder of this repository.

There are certain files that for the reason of the above problem is not uploaded to this repository such as binary files, sample data and other related non-textual files.

Meanwhile, I'm still working to solve the binary uploading problems.

You can contact me to obtain these files.

At this stage, the look up example only use tEmployee table. You can ignore other tables that will be used in the next stage of this open source project, perhaps with another name.
